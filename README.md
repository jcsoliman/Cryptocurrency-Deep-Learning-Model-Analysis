# Cryptocurrency Deep Learning Model Analysis
In this exercise, we will be employing deep learning recurrent neural networks to model bitcoin prices. In particular, we will build and evaluate two models - one using closing prices and another using [Crypto Fear and Greed Index (FNG)](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/).

# Methodology

In both models, we will be folllowing these steps:
